             * Advanced Samples
             *
             * These samples show optimised implementations of more complex algorithms. The source for these samples can be found in the folder of the SDK.
             *
             *     Texture Compression and Alpha Channels
             *
             *     This document describes the related samples "ETCAtlasAlpha", "ETCCompressedAlpha", and "ETCUncompressedAlpha", which illustrate three different ways of handling alpha channels when using ETC1 compression.
             *
             *     High Quality Text Rendering
             *
             *     Improving quality for textured text.
             *
             *     Thread Synchronisation
             *
             *     Illustrates the use of sync objects to synchronise the use of shared objects between multiple contexts in multiple threads.
             *
             *     Metaballs
             *
             *     Using a GPU to create organic-looking 3-dimensional objects in OpenGL ES 3.0.
             *
             *     Terrain Rendering with Geometry Clipmaps
             *
             *     This sample will show you how to efficiently implement geometry clipmaps using OpenGL ES 3.0. The sample makes use of 2D texture arrays as well as instancing to efficiently render an infinitely large terrain. The terrain is asynchronously uploaded to the GPU using pixel buffer objects.
             *
             *     Skybox
             *
             *     This sample presents how to implement skybox using single cubemap texture.
             *
             *     Advanced Shading Techniques with Pixel Local Storage
             *
             *     This sample uses OpenGL ES 3.0 and Pixel Local Storage to perform advanced shading techniques. The sample computes a per-pixel object thickness, and uses it to render a subsurface scattering effect for translucent geometry, without the use of external depth-maps or additional rendertargets.
             *
             *     ASTC textures
             *
             *     This document describes usage of compressed ASTC textures.
             *
             *     ASTC low precision
             *
             *     This document describes how to enable and use the ASTC decode mode extension to select decoding precision when decoding ASTC image blocks.
             *
             *     Introduction to compute shaders
             *
             *     This document will give you an introduction to compute shaders in OpenGL ES 3.1, how they fit into the rest of OpenGL ES and how you can make use of it in your application. Using compute shaders effectively requires a new mindset where parallel computation is exposed more explicitly to developers. With this explicitness, various new primitives are introduced which allows compute shader threads to share access to memory and synchronize execution.
             *
             *     Particle Flow Simulation with Compute Shaders
             *
             *     This sample illustrates how to efficiently perform calculations on a large amount of particles using OpenGL ES 3.1 and compute shaders.
             *
             *     Occlusion Culling with Hierarchical-Z
             *
             *     This sample will show you how to efficiently implement occlusion culling using compute shaders in OpenGL ES 3.1. The sample tests visibility for a large number of instances in parallel and only draws the instances which are assumed to be visible. Using this technique can in certain scenes give a tremendous performance increase.
             *
             *     Ocean Rendering with Fast Fourier Transform
             *
             *     This sample will show you how to efficiently implement high quality ocean water rendering using compute shaders in OpenGL ES 3.1.
             *
             *     Displacement mapping with tessellation
             *
             *     This sample uses OpenGL ES 3.1 and the Android extension pack to perform displacement mapping with tessellation. The sample investigates common techniques used to improve performance and visuals.
             *
             *     Procedural modelling with geometry shaders
             *
             *     This sample uses OpenGL ES 3.1 and the Android extension pack to procedurally generate complex geometry in real-time with geometry shaders.
             *
             * The rest of the advanced samples are summarised in Advanced OpenGL ES Samples
